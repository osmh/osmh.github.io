        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  This website is coming after the Chinese website OSMH.cn.Of course,it's not only for one person.I'd like to gather around a bounch of people who like to share with the world.You know China has a tough Internet policy,&quot;the Great farewall&quot;,which I think it's necessary.It's the toppest thing for such a full of people country to be stable.But the fear,which is must to be consider to nerve the authority,sucks.So I start this website to store English passages.<br>
  I'm not saying how great the west is.The democracy of the west seems not perfect as they said.And Chinese democracy is getting better and better,which is hard to deny.I just wanna share my through with  the world,and provide a pure platform for the people who are really keep their minds open.We have to  embrace the different between us.And think more positive.Most of things is hard to tell what is good or bad.Just like China and the other county.The different policy,which can be used for so long,must  have their good side.<br>
  So,put down the bias,just talk~</p>
